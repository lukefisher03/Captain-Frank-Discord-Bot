                        I was a bot created specifically for the game Among Us. On certain commands I can mute/unmute entire voice channels. That way you can restrict discussion while in game and then have voice chat while discussing suspects. Here's a little guide to get started:
                        
                        1. I need voice channel permissions to work!
                        2. The text channel you run commands in MUST contain the word "frank" in it. That way I don't accidentally act when I shouldn't
                        3. To mute/unmute a channel you say "frank mute" or "frank unmute" respectively.
                        4. The user who calls a mute/unmute command must be in the voice channel he wishes to mute!
                        
                        That's all folks, \nEnjoy playing Among Us!\n -Frank`
